A bare bones version of the MDI track browser.

This app has a single step with a fully 
functioning genome track browser that can be
used to:
- explore different genomes
- access UCSC genome browser tracks
- access local/server data files through standard track types
- develop functionalities of the the browser itself

The app/browser takes no data uploads and does not
offer any data- or app-specific browser tracks.
Please see other apps for extended uses of the track browser.
